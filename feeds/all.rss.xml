The idea of this blog is to become a collection of
community crowdsourced content about Puppet. You can publish your own content
instead of needing to host a blog yourself, repost it here or simply link to
an article on another blog or&amp;nbsp;site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The blog is run as an opensource project and is hosted on Github. You can
fork the project, create a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PR&lt;/span&gt; against the &lt;code&gt;source&lt;/code&gt; branch and if it passes
review it will get merged and&amp;nbsp;published.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re by no means done working on this but it&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;good enough&amp;#8221; for release right
now. The theme is a heavily modified version of the Pure Pelican theme and
although better structured still messy in a bunch of places. There&amp;#8217;s no auto-
deploy yet either for when &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s get merged but we&amp;#8217;re working on adding&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to all your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PR&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s!&lt;/p&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Daenney</dc:creator><pubDate>Mon, 21 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>tag:puppet-a-day.com,2014-04-21:blog/2014/04/21/introducing-puppet-a-day/</guid></item></channel></rss>
