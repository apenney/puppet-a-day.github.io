# Puppet-a-day

There already are plenty blog posts about Puppet, so why a whole blog? The problem we see is that even though people blog about Puppet, they tend to stop after a while. People's personal blogs are also not always that easy to discover.

The idea behind "Puppet a day" is that it will be run as a community project. People will be able to submit their own content which will get merged after review. The hope is that this will ensure a steady influx of content and the required review ensure that what we post is of good quality and that the code examples adhere to community style guides and best practices.

We'll also keep track of community software releases like r10k, Puppetboard, puppetdbquery and the like to raise visibility of these projects.

You can find the project on [Github](https://github.com/puppet-a-day/puppet-a-day.github.io). If you want to contribute some content, correct spelling mistakes, suggest improvements or repost one of your own articles just send us a PR!
