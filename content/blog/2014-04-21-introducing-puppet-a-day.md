summary: A community crowdsourced blog about Puppet

Welcome to "Puppet a day". The idea of this blog is to become a collection of
community crowdsourced content about Puppet. You can publish your own content
instead of needing to host a blog yourself, repost it here or simply link to
an article on another blog or site.

The blog is run as an opensource project and is hosted on Github. You can
fork the project, create a PR against the ``source`` branch and if it passes
review it will get merged and published.

We're by no means done working on this but it's "good enough" for release right
now. The theme is a heavily modified version of the Pure Pelican theme and
although better structured still messy in a bunch of places. There's no auto-
deploy yet either for when PR's get merged but we're working on adding that.

Looking forward to all your PR's!
